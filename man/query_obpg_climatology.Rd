\description{
Climatologies are stored at the first date upon which that climatology can
be computed for the mission.  For example, seasonal climatology for summer is
June 21, 2002 (for June, July and August).  These carry two dates (start and
stop) with the latter subject to updates.  So we search by pattern matching
the climatology period, the parameter and the resolution.  We break the search
when a match is found.  If more than one match is found then the latter is
retrieved under the assumption that it is the most recent update.
